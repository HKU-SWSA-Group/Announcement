## What is *HKU-SWSA-Group*?
This is an account used to share resources within our research group and release announcements to the public.
## Why Github?
GitHub is a development platform based on `Git` to make developer work together with a history track.
## What is Git?
- **Git** (/ɡɪt/) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
- You can find a basic tutorial of Git [here](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/896043488029600).
## What is the structure of the content?
- The `Repositorites` part stores all created repostorites, which are like project folders in our desktops. Each Repository should 
have a unique theme(Announcement, Books-Papers-Ideas, etc.). You can add a new repository easily by clicking button *New*. Please 
avoid creating repositories with similar themes and make sure to set repositories **private**. 
- Within each repository, there are individual folders and a public `README.md` file. You can creat a folder with your username 
and store your resources inside it. Afterwards, you should edit the `README.md` file with writing descriptions and attaching 
links to your shared resources. 
## How to contribute to this account?
- You can login in this account and edit all the repositorites easily.
- You can also download Git package in your own computer and use [`git clone`](https://www.yiibai.com/git/git_clone.html) 
and [`git push`](https://www.yiibai.com/git/git_push.html) commands to "pull" and "push" the repositorites.
